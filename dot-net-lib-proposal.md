# Proposal - .NET Library and Tutorial Git Book

A Dash .NET library and documentation in the form of a tutorial book similar to [Programming the Blockchain](https://programmingblockchain.gitbooks.io/programmingblockchain/content/).

### Overview

##### Summary

This proposal is to fund the creation and maintenance of "nDash". **nDash** will be an open source .net library for programming with the Dash blockchain. There is already an existing project "nbitcoin" for .net developers. It was created by the folks from [MetacoSA](https://github.com/MetacoSA). We would hire the developers of this library to collaborate with a group of us .net developers within the dash community and begin building the dash version.

We are requesting **three months of payments of x DASH** for this project.  This covers contracting with Metaco and our time developing the library.

##### Motivation

> "Having lots of people involved with Dash is what makes it successful!" - Evan Duffield

The primary motivation for this project is to increase the value of Dash by getting more developers from diverse languages into the Dash ecosystem.

* allow people to use the languages they are familier with to interact and build amazing projects with Dash

##### Terms

### Closing
If the project is funded we will develop another separate proposal to continue supporting the project into future months.  The scope, schedule, and budget for that revision will be based on community feedback.  

This project can grow as large as we wish.  The more financial incentive we can offer the more expansive the platform will become, which will lead to a healthier, more decentralized ecosystem.  The platform is ideal for
